# My favorite movies!

1. Tangled - This is a comfort movie. The songs are so good and I love a love story.
2. Hell House (LLC) - 10/10 Horror movie. I like that it's filmed like a documentary, I think it makes it feel more realistic.
3. Mullholland Drive - I was so confused the first time I watched, but once I understood it just became so cool. Like a puzzle.
4. The Labyrinth - I watched this all the time as a kid and always thought the labrinyth itself was kind of cool. Plus, DANCE BABY DANCE!
5. The Notebook - This is self explanatory. Best love story ever made.
6. Good Will Hunting - "I have to go see about a girl". Thats all.
