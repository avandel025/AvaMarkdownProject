# My Favorite Books
1. Divergent - This was the first book I ever liked, and I only read it after I loved the movie so much! The story is so much deepe rin the book, though.
2. Dont Look Back - This was a FANTASTIC first read when it came to mystery books. I wish I could read it for the first time again. The storytelling keeps you guessing.
3. The red canoe - We read this in 7th grade, and I still remember being more invested in the plot than I had ever been before. I should've started reading after that.
4. The inheritance games - Another mystery! I usually get bored with books because I feel like I know what's coming, and mysterys solve that problem. I felt like I was solving the puzzle with Avery the entire time!
